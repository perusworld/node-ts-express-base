# Node.js TypeScript Express - Prototype Backend

A sophisticated Node.js TypeScript Express prototype backend designed for **rapid prototyping, sales demos, and proof-of-concept development**. This project eliminates the friction of setting up infrastructure while providing realistic multi-tenant experiences for client presentations and development iterations.

## üéØ **Perfect For**

- **Sales Demos** - Show multi-tenant capabilities without database setup
- **Proof of Concepts** - Validate ideas quickly with working prototypes
- **Client Presentations** - Demonstrate system architecture and features
- **Developer Onboarding** - Show system design without infrastructure complexity
- **Hackathons** - Rapid prototyping with built-in multi-tenancy
- **MVP Development** - Focus on business logic, not infrastructure setup

## üöÄ **Key Features**

- **TypeScript** - Full TypeScript support with proper configuration
- **Express.js** - Latest Express.js framework for API development
- **Socket.IO** - Optional WebSocket support for real-time features
- **IP Restrictions** - Configurable IP address restrictions for demo environments
- **Logging** - Winston-based logging with configurable levels
- **Session Database Isolation** - **In-memory isolated database instances per session for demo isolation**
- **Async Task System** - Background task processing with progress tracking for workflow demonstrations
- **Multi-Tenant Demo Support** - Each demo user gets their own isolated data space
- **Testing** - Jest testing framework setup for development validation
- **Webpack** - Asset bundling and development tools

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Prototype/Demo Purpose**

**This is NOT a production-ready system.** It's designed for:

- **Rapid prototyping** and concept validation
- **Client demonstrations** without infrastructure setup
- **Development iterations** and feature testing
- **Sales presentations** showing system capabilities

**Production limitations:**

- All data is stored in-memory (lost on server restart)
- No database persistence or redundancy
- No horizontal scaling capabilities
- No failover or disaster recovery
- Single-server architecture

## üé≠ **Multi-Tenant Demo Magic**

The real value is in how it handles **demo scenarios**:

### **Session Isolation for Demos**

- Each demo user gets their own "database" instance
- No data cross-contamination between different client presentations
- Automatic session key generation from IP addresses
- Perfect for showing isolated data per customer without real database setup

### **In-Memory Per-Session Storage**

- Each session gets its own isolated data space
- Simulates real multi-tenant architecture
- No need to set up databases for each demo

### **Task System for Demo Workflows**

- Show long-running processes and progress tracking
- Demonstrate real-world workflow scenarios
- Simulate complex business processes

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
npm install
